# biolink
This project is a fork of takuyaÂ´s fantastic biolink tutorial.  
This is my first ever html project and it is simply an html site with all my socials.  
  
In this repo there are two "sites", firstly there is index.html, the main website which has a vido in the background, and secondly there is index-vanta.html, a site which uses a vanta.js backgrorund.  
Feel free to use my repo and edit it to your liking!  
Once again credits to Takuya for his fantastic tutorial.
